## Details:
  
  Inorder to help PlanMyTrip to help their customer we randomly generated 500 latitudes and longitudes, using citipy find the city details like name, country. Using open weather api we found the max temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, humidity of all the 500 cities and stored it in a csv file along with longitude,lattitude and country code for future use.
  
 Created scattered chart a) Lattitude vs Max Temperature, b) Lattitude vs Humidity, c)Lattitude vs Cloudiness, d)Lattitude vs Wind Speed to see the correlation of different attributes. ![Lattidute vs Max Temperature](weather_data/Fig1.png)![Lattidute vs Humidity](weather_data/Fig2.png)![Lattidute vs Cloudiness](weather_data/Fig3.png)![Lattidute vs Wind Speed](weather_data/Fig4.png). Except Lattitude vs Max Temperature none of them seems to have any useful relationship.
